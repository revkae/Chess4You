# Chess4You
It is a practice project completed in three weeks, and it was my first attempt at learning graphical programming. The project was developed using the LWJGL library with OpenGL. In the future, I plan to add sound, AI, a menu, and text rendering to this game, but for now, it can only be played solo. The engine needs some improvements as its current capability is limited to drawing objects.
