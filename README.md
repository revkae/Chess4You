# ChessForYou
It is a practice project done in 3 weeks and it was my first approach to learning graphical programming. Made with lwjgl library using opengl. In future I am gonna add sound, ai, menu, text rendering to this game but for know it can be only played by yourself. Need some improvements on engine because its only capability is drawing stuff.
